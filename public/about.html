<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>After being closely surrounded by programmers for the mostpart of my adult life, the time
  has come for me to embrace what the Universe seems to be trying to tell me.  </p>

<p>I have realized how satisfying code is to me, as it's a craft that needs to be exactly correct
  for it to work. As uneven edges stress me out and cornes without straight angles tears on my
  soul, I find solace and comfort in the fact that in code, there is no such thing
  as "almost correct" or "good enough". What I create has to be right for the outcome to look right. 
</p>

<p>I love it.</p>
